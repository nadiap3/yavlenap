# Nadia's practical notebook

The main purpose of this repository is to advance my knowledge in automation testing. I'm implementing a test suite for the Yavlena Real Estate website.

I'm using **Playwright** as a framework and the **page object model** to structure my test suite.

I currently have the start of an end-to-end test suite with a few tests for 3 of the pages on the website.

###Installation process

- Clone the repository
- npm i
- npx playwright test

> I recommend having the Playwright desktop app installed and running **npx playwright test --ui**
